# Elessar

Orthanc Explorer in dark mode. PHP gettext translation. PDF &amp; JPG uploaders. 

"The Elessar I leave with thee, for there are grievous hurts to Middle-earth which thou maybe shalt heal."

This "tuning" is entirely based on the original Orthanc Explorer that can be found in https://www.orthanc-server.com/

Motivated to avoid the visual stress of a white background, the interface matches the colors of the Osimis Webviewer Elesser adaption.

Pre-requisites

The login/register are running in traditional PHP.
The translation has been done using  gettext 
The JPG and PDF uploaders rely on CURL, DCMTK and GhostScript
